Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere. As a result, global temperatures rise, leading to melting ice caps and rising sea levels. Extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes and droughts become more frequent. To combat global warming, the use of renewable energy sources and conservation efforts are essential.",0.03
"Digestion is the process by which the body breaks down food into nutrients. It begins in the mouth, where enzymes start breaking down carbohydrates. The stomach further processes food using acids and digestive enzymes. Nutrients are then absorbed in the intestines and transported to cells through the bloodstream. Any undigested food is expelled from the body as waste.","Digestion is the process by which the body breaks down food into nutrients.
